DATA ANALYST INTERNSHIP TASK 2
#  Superstore Analytics Dashboard

##  About the Project
This dashboard was created as part of my Data Analyst internship task focused on **Data Visualization and Storytelling**. The goal was to explore sales data and turn it into a clear, meaningful story using visuals.

##  Dataset Used
- **Dataset:** Sample - Superstore.xls
- It includes details like sales, profit, order returns, categories, sub-categories, regions, and time.

##  What I Did
Using **Power BI**, I built a dashboard to help understand:
- How much we sold and earned (Sales & Profit)
- How things have changed compared to the previous year
- Which categories and sub-categories perform best or worst
- Where (geographically) our top sales are coming from

###  The Dashboard Includes:
- **KPI Cards** showing total sales, total profit, and % of returned orders
- **Bar Chart** comparing sub-category profits year-over-year
- **Line Chart** showing monthly sales trends vs previous year
- **Map Visualization** highlighting sales performance across U.S. states

##  Key Takeaways
- We made **$2.33 million in sales** with a **profit of $292.3K**
- **Technology** and **Office Supplies** categories brought in the most profit
- **Tables** and **Bookcases** were not profitable
- **California** and **New York** are our best-performing states

##  Tools Used
- Power BI (for building the dashboard)
- Excel (to view and understand the raw data)

##  What I Learned
- How to tell a story through charts, not just numbers
- Choosing the right type of chart (bar, line, map, etc.)
- Designing clean, informative dashboards that are easy to read
- Creating KPIs and comparing current vs past performance
